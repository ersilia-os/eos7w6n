    "Description": "GROVER is a self-supervised Graph Neural Network for molecular representation pretrained with 10 million unlabelled molecules from ChEMBL and ZINC15. The model provided has been pre-trained on 10 million molecules (GROVERlarge). GROVER has then been fine-tuned to predict several activities from the MoleculeNet benchmark, consistently outperforming other state-of-the-art methods for serveral benchmark datasets.\n",
